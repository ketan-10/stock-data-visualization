# Stock data visualizer

- [ðŸŸ¢ Live](www.ketan.link/stock-data-visualization) 

## Very lightweight
-  Project has following 3 dependencies   
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@headlessui/vue": "^1.7.19",
    "lightweight-charts": "^4.1.3",
    "vue": "^3.4.21"
},
```
- As the name suggest [`@headlessui/vue`](https://headlessui.com/) is a headless ui library. 
- I am big fan of headless libraries. as they do not render anything visual on screen. That way we get pixel perfect control, at the expense of writing your own components. <br>
- Another example of headless ui library is [radix-vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/) all of them are very lightweight.
- Whole [dist directory](https://github.com/ketan-10/stock-data-visualization/tree/gh-pages) including all assets is 280kb (without zipping)
